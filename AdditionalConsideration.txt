Additional Consideration:

Error Handling: 
        -> Implementing error handling and validation so when there are issues in the
           registration, verification and login.

Security Measures:
        -> Add proper sanitization to input fields so that we can protect the Hackers,
           attacker from executing Server-Side Injection, Cross-Site Injections and
           Cross Site Request Forgery.  
        -> Add Rate limiting also can help avoiding attacks Denial Of Service and 
           Distributed Denial of Service.

Logging and Monitoring:
        -> Logging and Monitoring should be implemented so we can get proper logs of 
           any errors or suspicious activities that are done on the Website.

Privacy: 
        -> Compliance for data protection. Handling user data securely.
