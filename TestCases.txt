Registration Page Test Cases: (Jest Unit Test cases)

-> Presence of Required Fields:
        -> Verify that the registration page contains the following required fields:
           username, email, password, confirm password, and any other necessary fields.
        -> Ensure that these fields are present in the HTML form structure.

-> Successful User Registration:
        -> Enter valid values for all required fields and submit the registration form.
        -> Verify that the user is successfully registered and can log in to the application
           using the provided credentials.
        Eg. 
        // function registerUser(username, email, password) { //Logic of registration page }
        // describe('registerUser', () => {
        // it('registers a user with valid input', () => {    
        //  const username = 'testuser';
        //  const email = 'test@example.com';
        //  const password = 'password';
        //
        //  const result = registerUser(username, email, password);
        //
        //  expect(result).toEqual(expect.objectContaining({
        //      success: true,
        //      message: 'User registered successfully',
        //    }));
        // });

-> Error Message for Existing Username:
        ->  Attempt to register with a username that already exists in the system.
        ->  Verify that an appropriate error message is displayed indicating that the username
            is already taken.
        Eg. 
        // function registerUser(username, email, password) { //Logic of registration page }
        // describe('registerUser', () => {
        // it('registers a user with valid input', () => {    
        //  const username = 'testuser';
        //  const email = 'test@example.com';
        //  const password = 'password';
        //
        //  const result = registerUser(username, email, password);
        //
        //  expect(result).not.toEqual(expect.objectContaining({
        //      success: false,
        //      message: 'User name already registered',
        //    }));
        // });

-> Marking of Required Fields:
        ->  Check that all required fields are visually marked with an asterisk (*) symbol in 
            the UI.
        ->  Inspect the HTML code or CSS styles to confirm the presence of this marker.

-> Usage of UI Components:
        ->  Ensure that the registration page incorporates suitable UI components like 
            dropdowns, radio buttons, checkboxes, etc., wherever applicable, instead of just 
            text boxes.
        ->  Validate that these UI components are utilized for relevant fields.

-> Submit and Cancel/Reset Buttons:
        ->  Verify that the registration page includes both a submit button and a cancel/reset 
            button at the end.
            Interact with the buttons and confirm their functionality.

-> Submitting Valid Data:
        ->  Enter valid values for all required fields and click the submit button.
        ->  Confirm that the entered data is sent to the server for processing.

-> Cancel/Reset Functionality:
        -> Enter valid values for all required fields and click the cancel/reset button.
        -> Check that the submission request is canceled, and all the fields are reset to 
           their initial state.

-> Validation Error for Missing Mandatory Fields:
        ->  Leave the mandatory fields empty and click the submit button.
        ->  Verify that a validation error is displayed, indicating that the required fields
            must be filled.

-> Optional Fields and Validation:
        ->  Leave the optional fields blank and click the submit button.
        ->  Confirm that no validation error occurs and the registration is successful.

-> Client-Side Validation:
        ->  Test the client-side validation by attempting to submit the form without entering
            a username and password.
        ->  Validate that the client-side validation triggers and displays appropriate error 
            messages without sending blank entries to the server.

-> Upper Limit of Textbox Fields:
        -> Enter text exceeding the allowed maximum length for each textbox field.
        -> Verify that the input is truncated or not accepted based on the defined upper limit.

-> Validation for Date and Email Fields:
        -> Enter invalid dates (e.g., in the wrong format or out of range) and invalid email addresses.
        -> Check that the system rejects these inputs and displays validation errors.

-> Validation on Numeric Fields:
        -> Enter alphabets and special characters in numeric fields.
        -> Ensure that the system rejects these inputs and displays validation errors.

-> Trimming of Leading and Trailing Spaces:
        -> Enter values with leading and trailing spaces in various fields.
        -> Confirm that the system trims these spaces before storing the data on the server.




Login Page Test Cases: 
    

-> UI Test:
    -> Presence of Labels and Controls:
        -> Inspect the Login page and verify that all labels, controls, text boxes, buttons,
           and links are present.
        -> Check the HTML code or UI framework used to ensure the existence of these elements.

    -> Visibility of Labels and Text:
        -> Check that the font type and size of the labels and the text on different elements
           are clearly visible.
        -> Ensure that the text has sufficient contrast with the background and is readable.

    -> Compliance with Design Specifications:
        -> Compare the size, color, and UI of the different elements on the Login page with 
           the specified design guidelines.
        -> Validate that the elements match the defined specifications accurately.

    -> Responsive UI:
        -> Test the application's UI responsiveness by accessing the Login page on different
           devices and screen resolutions.
        -> Verify that the UI adjusts appropriately, ensuring a consistent user experience 
           across various devices and screen sizes.

    -> Media Queries and CSS:
        -> Inspect the CSS code or media queries used in the application to confirm that they
           handle different screen resolutions and devices effectively.
        -> Test the Login page on various viewport sizes to ensure proper rendering and layout
           adjustments.

    -> Device-specific UI Elements:
        -> Check if the Login page displays device-specific UI elements, such as virtual
           keyboards on mobile devices or touch-friendly buttons.
        -> Verify that these elements are available and function correctly on the respective
           devices.

    -> Testing with Browser DevTools:
        -> Use browser development tools to simulate different screen resolutions and device 
           types.
        -> Inspect the Login page's layout and behavior in the simulated environments to ensure
           responsiveness.

    -> Cross-Browser Compatibility:
        -> Test the Login page on different browsers (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to 
           check for any rendering issues or inconsistencies.
        -> Verify that the UI remains consistent and functional across the supported browsers.

    -> Accessibility Considerations:
        -> Evaluate the Login page for accessibility compliance, ensuring that it meets WCAG 
           (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) standards.
        -> Verify that elements have appropriate aria-labels, alt text, and proper semantic structure to support assistive technologies.

    -> Localization Support:
        -> If the application supports multiple languages, verify that the Login page elements,
           including labels and controls, are properly localized.
        -> Change the language settings and confirm that the UI elements adapt to the selected
           language.

    -> Cross-Platform Testing:
        -> Test the Login page on different operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux) to 
           ensure consistent behavior and appearance across platforms.

    -> Automated Testing:
        -> Utilize automated testing frameworks or tools to perform UI testing on the Login 
           page.
        -> Write test scripts to validate the presence, visibility, and attributes of labels, 
           controls, and other UI elements.
