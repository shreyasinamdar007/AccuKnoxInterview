User Registration:

-> User Interface:
        1) Create a registration form which includes input fields namely 
           User Email, Full Name, Username, Password, Confirm Password.
        2) We can make use of component libraries like Material UI or 
           Chakra UI, but would prefer to use SCSS as Material UI component 
           libraries increase the bundle size.

-> Validation:
        Implement validation for all the fields.
        1) Email -> Valid Email format  
        2) Full Name -> Should only have alphabets and exclude every other 
                        character or symbol.
        3) Username -> Username should be tested for uniqueness
        4) Password -> Password should be strong and have minimum 8 characters
                       and should have characters, numbers and atleast one symbol.
        5) Confirm Password -> Confirm password should have validation check and 
                               will be valid if and only if it matches the Password
                               field 

-> Backend API: 
        1) Implementation of backend api for Registering and Storing data securely.
        2) Making use of PostgreSQL database for storing. Database should be choosed 
           according to use case.
        3) Storing password in hashed format for security purpose and also adding salt
           to it.

-> Email Verification:
        1) Generating a unique verification token and send it to it user's provided 
           email address.
